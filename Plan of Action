There are 3 types of actions - Active, Defensive, Responsive:
 Active involves math heavy problems of check dam construction ,etc. to get ahead of the threat. 
 Defensive actions involve resource allocation problems of sending the right amount of boats to correct places based on weather data, 
 Responsive actions involve political decisions of prioritizing which people for evacuation, handling of Rohingya migrants, etc. \


🔺 ACTION CATEGORIES (EXPANDED)
1️⃣ ACTIVE ACTIONS

Math-heavy, proactive, high leverage, often irreversible

These are taken before damage peaks. Fewer in number, higher impact.

Examples
A1. Check Dam Placement (Expected Value)

As before:

𝐸
𝑉
=
(
1
−
𝑝
𝑓
𝑎
𝑖
𝑙
)
×
flow reduction
EV=(1−p

	​

)×flow reduction
A2. Embankment Reinforcement Allocation

You have E units of reinforcement, split among segments.

Each segment 
𝑖
i has:

Stress 
𝑆
𝑖
S
i
	​


Reinforcement 
𝑟
𝑖
r
i
	​


Failure probability:

)
p

)

Goal: minimize total expected breach:

∑
𝑝
𝑖
∑p
i
	​


Simple integer allocation problem.

A3. Controlled Floodplain Release

Deliberately allow flooding in one region to save others.

Each region has:

Population 
𝑃
P

Storage capacity 
𝐶
C

Water diverted reduces downstream flood by:

Δ
𝑊
=
𝛼
⋅
𝐶
ΔW=α⋅C

Ethical + math tradeoff.

A4. Reservoir Release Timing

Release now vs later.

Early release → smaller downstream flood

Late release → risk dam failure

Player compares:

𝐸
(
early loss
)
𝑣
𝑠
𝐸
(
catastrophic failure
)
E(early loss)vsE(catastrophic failure)
A5. Pump Network Optimization

Pumps reduce water logarithmically:

Δ
𝑊
=
𝑘
⋅
ln
⁡
(
1
+
𝑛
)
ΔW=k⋅ln(1+n)

Diminishing returns → encourages spreading pumps.

2️⃣ DEFENSIVE ACTIONS

Operational, logistical, resource-limited

These happen every turn.

Examples
D1. Boat Allocation

Each district:

Flood level 
𝐹
F

Population trapped 
𝑃
P

𝑊
W

𝑅

D2. Helicopter Deployment

Binary success:

𝑃
(
flight
)
=
1
−
fog probability
P(flight)=1−fog probability

High cost, high reward.

D3. Camp Capacity Planning

Overcrowding penalty:

Disease Risk
∝
people
capacity
Disease Risk∝
capacity
people
	​

D4. Fuel Logistics

Fuel decays per turn.
Over-commitment now → no mobility later.

D5. Engineer Deployment

Engineers reduce future failure probabilities but consume transport.

3️⃣ RESPONSIVE ACTIONS

Political, ethical, perception-based; numbers are fuzzy

These don’t always affect flood mechanics directly, but strongly influence outcomes.

Examples
R1. Evacuation Priority Decision

Choose priority:

Children & elderly

Urban professionals

Migrant workers

Rohingya refugee camps

Each affects:

Trust

Media

Long-term stability

R2. Rohingya Camp Handling

Options:

Full evacuation (high backlash risk)

Partial aid (security risk)

No evacuation (humanitarian cost)

Hidden future consequences.

R3. Media Strategy

Transparency → trust + panic

Control → stability – credibility

R4. Political Visit Scheduling

Allows funding but freezes operations.

R5. Inter-State Water Dispute Response

Assam vs Arunachal coordination impacts upstream releases.

▶️ EXTENDED SAMPLE PLAYTHROUGH (12 TURNS)

Each turn = 12 hours

TURN 1 — INITIAL SETUP

Heavy rainfall forecast (σ = high)

Player takes:

D1: Boats split evenly

R3: Transparent media briefing

TURN 2 — ACTIVE: CHECK DAM

Player solves expected value → selects Site C
Flow reduced by 25%

TURN 3 — DEFENSIVE: BOAT ALLOCATION

Weather worsens in Dhemaji

Player reallocates boats from Dibrugarh

Outcome:

Rural rescues up

Urban criticism begins

TURN 4 — RESPONSIVE: MIGRANT CAMPS

Rohingya camps flooding.

Player chooses:

“Partial evacuation with military supervision”

Outcome:

Trust ↑ internationally

Security risk flagged

TURN 5 — ACTIVE: EMBANKMENT REINFORCEMENT

Player allocates 6 units across 3 segments.

Math-driven decision:

Minimizes expected breach

Outcome:

One minor breach instead of two

TURN 6 — DEFENSIVE: HELICOPTER GAMBLE

Fog probability = 0.6

Player flies anyway.

Outcome roll:

2 succeed

1 forced landing → resource loss

TURN 7 — RESPONSIVE: MEDIA STORM

Video of stranded villagers goes viral.

Player chooses:

Divert resources publicly

Or stick to original plan

Chooses: Divert

Outcome:

Trust ↑

Logistics efficiency ↓

TURN 8 — ACTIVE: CONTROLLED FLOODING

Player floods agricultural floodplain.

Math:

Sacrifice 10k livelihoods

Save 50k urban residents

Outcome:

Long-term unrest risk added

TURN 9 — DEFENSIVE: HEALTH CRISIS

Disease risk crosses threshold.

Player reallocates:

Medical teams from rescues

Outcome:

Short-term deaths ↑

Epidemic prevented

TURN 10 — RESPONSIVE: POLITICAL PRESSURE

Minister demands refinery protection.

Player complies.

Outcome:

Economy saved

Rural anger ↑

TURN 11 — ACTIVE: RESERVOIR RELEASE

Player calculates expected catastrophic loss.

Releases early.

Outcome:

Flood peak reduced

Minor downstream damage

TURN 12 — RESOLUTION

Rain subsides.

Final Metrics

Lives saved: High

Civil unrest risk: Medium

International image: High

Army readiness: Reduced

🧠 WHY THIS DESIGN WORKS

Active actions = few, math-heavy, decisive

Defensive actions = frequent, resource-limited

Responsive actions = messy, political, long-term

Player cannot optimize all three.
